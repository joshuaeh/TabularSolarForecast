### Getting Started

#### Create a Virtual Environment

Generally it will be a good idea to create a virtual environment for this project, that way dependencies don't conflict. To create a virtual environment do the following:  
`cd SolarProphet/` change active directory to the SolarProphet directory  

1. `python3 -m venv --copies .venv` The command `-m` will use the python module `venv` to install a virtual environment in the directory `SolarProphet/.venv`. `--copies` is optional and installs all modules locally rather than refering to globally installed packages. You may occasionally run into conflicts where pip says you have something installed already. This is probably a case by case problem depending on your environment.  
2. Activate the environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`. If you ever want ti disactivate this environmemt, use the command `deactivate`.
